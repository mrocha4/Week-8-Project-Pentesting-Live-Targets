# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

## Red

- [ ] Vulnerability #1: IDOR![](https://i.imgur.com/06LcIV1.gif)


## Notes

What I most struggled with was with CSRF, the rest of the vulnerabilities weren't as difficult to me.
